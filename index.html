    <h2>Our Product</h2>
    <p>
        Current gait analysis technologies are lacking in one way or another. We are aiming to develop a cheap, real-time insole gait tracking system that will link to a userâ€™s mobile phone. The mobile application will collate information about their gait and present it to them in an easy-to-understand way, empowering them to better understand their illness and how we treat it. This system will work by extracting features from their gait and presenting how these have evolved over time, giving users and their health care providers a better idea of the course of their illness. By collating this disease progression data over sets of users we can provide effective triaging for health care providers and institutions. By giving health care providers the ability to collect objective, accurate and constant gait analysis on the cloud we believe that we can streamline the care of users in medical, surgical, and allied health care contexts. This streamlining and triaging allows for more efficient delivery of health care services amongst a population, resulting in lower costs and better care for the end user.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p>
        We are a group of three tenacious entrepreneurs. Two of us are near the end of our medical degrees (MD) and one of us has a Masters in Electrical Engineering. We are published in several journals in subjects such as Solid State Physics and Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. With our highly technical background we bring fresh perspectives to the medical field. As innovators we want to bring precise and personalised digital healthcare to the forefront of medical and surgical treatment. We believe that we can democratise first class medical care and bring affordable best practice to everyone. As future clinicians we understand the values and principles that guide medical practice. Our understanding of the multi-faceted problems in the medical space and our ability to envision the future of healthcare and build it exactly are what set us apart.
